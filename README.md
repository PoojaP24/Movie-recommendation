# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques in Python. The goal is to provide users with movie recommendations that align with their preferences and viewing history.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the machine learning model.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: This technique makes automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users.
- **Machine Learning**: Various ML techniques are used to train the recommendation model.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to have access to the Python scripts.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project should contain user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings. It should be preprocessed and cleaned for optimal results.

## Implementation
The implementation involves several steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and preprocessed. Any missing or inconsistent data is handled in this step.
2. **Model Training**: The preprocessed data is used to train the recommendation model using collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques.
3. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
4. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict movie recommendations for the users.

## Running the Code
Run the Python script to train the model and generate movie recommendations. 

## Future Work
Improvements can be made by incorporating more features into the model, such as movie genres or user demographics. Additionally, more advanced machine learning techniques can be explored.

## Conclusion
This project provides a robust and effective movie recommendation system. It demonstrates the power of collaborative filtering and machine learning in providing personalized user experiences.
